### Future Additions

I would like to improve the front end to this application, and try using another GUI interface. Also I would like to increase CRUD capabilities.

### Final Thoughts

This was my first Python program and it was surprisingly easy to make the transition from Javascript. While the syntax was different, my approach to coding was very similar. I can't wait to explore more with Python.
